                        <p>
                            I just last week found my passion, it's building websites (and coding in general).

                            So in 2017 my friend from high-school suggested me to use website called <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">Sololearn</a> and I wasn't really that interested at first.

                        <p>
                            Google has been the most popular search engine for decades, it owns over <strong>90%</strong> of the market share. Is there any great alternatives, and most importantly <em><strong>Why you should bother to switch?</strong></em> 
                        </p>

                            Internet is great, isn't it? We have almost infinite amount of information between our tiny hands because of it.

                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>
                            Is there life beyond Facebook? That’s the question what I asked when I started looking for Facebook alternatives after the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. After a little research I came up with a service called Minds, and I decided to give it a try.
                        </p>
                        
                        <img class="minds-image" src="minds-logo.jpg" width="800px" height="500px" border=black>
                        
                        <h5> About Minds </h5>
                        
                        <p>
                            Minds is a free and open-source distributed social media network that claims to support and embrace internet freedom, privacy, transparency and free speech. It currently has little over 1.5 million accounts and more than 110 000 active monthly users, so it doesn’t compete with the “big boys” just yet.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Minds uses different business model than most of its peers. The service isn’t ad-supported, which makes the usability a lot better. They use optional subscription, <a href="https://www.minds.com/plus">Minds Plus</a>, and donations to fund their service. Minds, in fact, actually pays for you to use their service and contribute on the community by giving you “tokens”, that are an cryptocurrency called ERC-20. You can use it to promote your own content or give tips to other creators.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Bill Ottman and Mark Harding co-founded Minds in 2011 and the service was publicly launched in June 2015. The idea behind Minds was to create alternative to the tech giant Facebook, which abused online rights radically.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h5> My personal experience with Minds </h5>
                        
                        <p>
                            When you first head out to their website you will see quite a clean looking interface. You will also see introduction of  their three core principles and some trending posts and news.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Creating account is an easy process that anyone knows how to do. Minds will require your email (for resetting password) and username (for ex. to people to find your profile), which is quite good since you don’t have to give any personally identifiable information.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            After signing in you will be prompted to the newsfeed page, which also feels very professional and clean. I would consider the service easy to use. User interface doesn't feel completely different from Facebook, so you don’t have to worry about radical change in that area. One thing that I noticed was I could easily find new fascinating people and services that I didn’t see in any other medias. Also, what I have talked with people on Minds, they seem really warm and welcoming, so thumbs up for that!
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Minds also has a private messenger, which offers end-to-end encryption that ensures your private data to stay safe. The messenger is great, but it also lacks some features that other competitors have, like an ability send audio files and make calls.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Minds has currently available apps for Android and IOS, but is usable with every device via a web browser.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Like every product and service, Minds isn’t perfect. The biggest problem with the service is the lack of people to follow. In the other hand, I’m sure that will get at least a bit better over the next few years.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Other notable problems are the amount of annoying boosted (paid to be the first in the newsfeed) content and the fact that there aren’t easy to find and clear guides and explanations about the company’s crypto things.
                        </p>

                            -The little lack of great content and people
                            <br>
                            -Lack of clear guides

                        <h5> The Verdict </h5>
                        
                        <p>
                            Minds is still a relatively new face in the industry and it still has many problems to overcome. But the fact that they are creating something new and doing it their own way makes my heart warm up. It’s left to see if they are able to become one of the “mainstream” platforms some day.
                        </p>
